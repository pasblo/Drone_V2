  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// Pin 11 has the LED on Teensy 2.0
// Pin 6  has the LED on Teensy++ 2.0
// Pin 13 has the LED on Teensy 3.0
// give it a name:
int led1 = 26;
int led2 = 27;
int led3 = 28;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(led3, HIGH);
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led1, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(led2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(led3, LOW);
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
